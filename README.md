## Tools Used

The Admin Dashboard is built using the following tools and libraries:

- **useContext:** A React hook used for passing data across components without having to pass props through intermediary components.

## Design Techniques

The Admin Dashboard incorporates the following design techniques to enhance the user experience:

- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on various devices. However, due to time constraints, the dashboard may not be fully responsive on all devices. You can help us by contributing to the responsive design.



- **Modular Components:** Components are designed to be reusable and independent, promoting maintainability and scalability.
- **Data Context:** The `useContext` hook is used to manage and share data across components, reducing the need for prop drilling.
- **Custom Styling:** Styled-Components allows for customizing component styles and encapsulating them with the component logic.
- **Consistent Theming:** A consistent theme is applied throughout the application using Styled-Components theming capabilities.
